# üß† Pok√©mon Image Generator using DCGAN & StyleGAN

This project explores the use of **Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN)** and **StyleGAN** for generating synthetic Pok√©mon-like characters. Our goal is to create high-quality, diverse Pok√©mon-style images using generative deep learning techniques.

## üß† Model Architectures

- **DCGAN**:
  - Generator and Discriminator built using convolutional layers.
  - Trained on a dataset of Pok√©mon sprites.
  - Outputs 64x64 pixel Pok√©mon-like images.

- **StyleGAN**:
  - Style-based generator architecture.
  - Produces more detailed and high-fidelity Pok√©mon samples.
  - Built to improve quality and diversity beyond DCGAN.
